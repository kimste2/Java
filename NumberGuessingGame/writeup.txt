This is a number guessing game where the target number is  between zero and one hundred inclusive. 
The user has ten tries to guess the correct number.  This was a good lesson in importing a scanner and
random number objects. While the Java syntax is similar to C the use of objects in place of functions 
is taking some getting used to.
